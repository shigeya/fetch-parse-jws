Si presenta come prossima al collasso e prevede il peggio. In poche ore la residua fiducia ha ceduto allo sconforto. L'esodo lento dei giorni scorsi ha assunto la dimensione della fuga. Oltre quattro milioni di abitanti hanno lasciato la città in treno, o ammassati in auto. Colletti bianchi, stranieri e famiglie con bambini cercano di raggiungere le località a sud del Kansai, per mettersi al riparo dal pericolo della nube atomica. Nella periferia nord di Tokyo arriva invece l'onda dei disperati che scappano da Fukushima e dalle città distrutte dallo tsunami. A far precipitare la situazione, l'innalzamento del livello di rischio nei reattori, nuove scosse di terremoto e la convinzione che il governo minimizzi una crisi fuori controllo. È scattato però anche il primo vero allarme-contaminazione. Il governo ha ammesso che tracce di iodio radioattivo sono state rinvenute nell'acqua potabile di Tokyo e delle aree vicine. Livelli anomali, ufficialmente sotto i limiti di legge e non immediatamente pericolosi per la salute, ma l'impatto pubblico della notizia è stato tremendo. Radioattivi anche il latte proveniente da Fukishima e alcune partite di spinaci prodotti nella prefettura di Ibaraki. Già in commercio, non si sa dove siano finiti. La popolazione dell'area metropolitana, oltre 35 milioni di individui, prende atto che la vita di una delle capitali più importanti del mondo è già irriconoscibile. La domanda non è più quando Tokyo tornerà al business e alla quotidianità smarrita, ma se ciò risulterà possibile. Il crollo del traffico e della folla per strada è impressionante.Pochi passanti, protetti da cappelli, ombrelli e mascherine, ignorano i centri commerciali del centro, in gran parte chiusi. La sindrome da alimenti contaminati lascia deserti i ristoranti e decima chi finora si era dedicato all'accaparramento di viveri. A Ginza, la via dello shopping, alcuni ambulanti mettono all'asta compresse di iodio sul marciapiede, a prezzi esorbitanti, come fossero spacciatori. A ruba un unico genere: i giornali che informano sugli orari dei black-out. Da tre giorni l'immondizia si accumula per le strade. I camion sono privi di benzina e gli inceneritori non possono sprecare elettricità. Solo il tempio di Senso-Ji, ad Asakusa, è affollato più del solito. La gente si raduna a pregare e a bruciare incenso. I cibi confezionati, purché prodotti prima dell'11 marzo, sono introvabili e il loro prezzo è salito di sette volte. Invenduti i generi freschi. Migliaia di taxi sostano in attesa di clienti già lontani, mentre le stazioni dei treni scoppiano di viaggiatori carichi di scatole e valigie. Molti distributori di carburante sono chiusi e quelli aperti non vendono più di dieci litri di benzina a testa, da portarsi via in una tanica. Il mercato immobiliare è impazzito. In una settimana il valore delle case a Tokyo è sceso del 30%, del 70% nella prefettura di Fukushima. A Osaka, Kyoto e Kobe è salito del 40%.Grattacieli con migliaia di uffici si svuotano nella capitale, mentre affittare lontano può superare i listini di Hong Kong. Tra venerdì e ieri la fuga di multinazionali, ambasciate, banche e centri amministrativi delle industrie, ha seminato il panico tra chi non ha un luogo sicuro dove rifugiarsi. Nel distretto finanziario migliaia di impiegati stanno sgomberando armadi e scrivanie, restituendo un'immagine da crack in Borsa. La capitale trasloca a Kyoto, come un tempo, oppure a portata dell'aeroporto internazionale di Osaka. A Tokyo i grandi alberghi chiudono, a sud è impossibile trovare una camera per settimane. La rabbia contro il governo è sempre meno trattenuta. ""Devono dire in anticipo cosa può succedere - dice Reiko Fukushima, direttore di un'importante catena di negozi - non confessare quanto è già avvenuto. Se la nube atomica investe Tokyo non possono pretendere che smettiamo di respirare"". Il premier Naoto Kan ha invitato invano l'opposizione di centrodestra a formare un direttorio di unità nazionale, per affrontare uniti l'emergenza più grave dalla fine della seconda guerra mondiale. All'agonia di Tokyo e allo spettro di un'esplosione nucleare, si somma l'ecatombe nelle prefetture sommerse dallo tsunami. La capitale è presa d'assalto da migliaia di eco-evacuati e da decine di migliaia di senza tetto fuggiti da gelo, fame e terrore. Volontari distribuiscono pasti, acqua e coperte. La folla dei disperati ha però bisogno di medicine, toilette, letti, di lavarsi e cambiare vestiti fradici. L'intero villaggio di Futunaba, vicino a Fukushima, ieri è stato trasferito a Saitanama, poco a nord di Tokyo, causando la sollevazione dei residenti. Secondo i medici l'emergenza igienico-sanitaria, con 800 mila persone costrette per ragioni diverse ad abbandonare case e ospedali, è prossima ad esplodere non solo nelle zone disastrate. Tragico il problema dello smaltimento delle vittime dello tsunami, fra 25 e 40 mila. I forni crematori non hanno energia e le bare finiscono in fosse comuni. In Giappone l'inumazione è una traumatica novità: l'ultima violenza di un incubo che sembra lontano dalla fine.",9,http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2011/03/20/news/tokyo_capitale_in_agonia-13852633/

Le radiazioni sono state rilevate su 14 kg di fave provenienti da Kagoshima, nel sud del Giappone, quindi a notevole distanza dalla centrale nucleare Fukushima-1, danneggiata dal sisma/tsunami dell'11 marzo.

This is quite a nerve centre and it is here that they take daily readings of radiation levels. In fact, they do it on an hourly basis.

AJW (Asahi Japan Watch) by the Asahi Shimbun published the following on their facebook page, which shows a calculation based on *extreme* conditions and not based on fact.NSC releases predicted radiation exposure using extreme conditionsAfter coming under fire, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan for the first time on Wednesday released predicted ranges of radiation exposure and radioactive materials from the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.The calculations were made using the System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information (SPEEDI).Emphasizing that its predictions were based on extreme conditions, the commission said the thyroid glands of 1-year-old infants could be exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation over a 12-day period--even outside a 30-kilometer radius from the plant--if iodine is dispersed in a northwesterly and southerly directions.The government had recommended that residents living within a 20-km radius evacuate and that those living between a 20- to 30-km radius remain indoors as much as possible.""We made the calculations using very extreme conditions. There will be no need to implement measures immediately,"" NSC Chairman Haruki Madarame said.The calculations were based on the scenario of infants being outdoors for the entire 12-day period between 6 a.m. March 12 and midnight Wednesday, after the Great East Japan Earthquake struck on March 11 and damaged the nuclear plant.The calculations found that if the infant remained indoors exposure to iodine would decrease to one-quarter to one-tenth of the most extreme calculation.The levels of radioactive iodine dispersed were calculated based on radiation monitoring data recorded at various locations, and the exposure calculation was made for a 1-year child whose thyroid gland would be most affected by iodine.The NSC had previously not released such predictions, saying the data were only rough figures that could be inaccurate. Critics said the commission should release as much information as possible about the nuclear crisis.According to Wednesday's calculations, the municipalities where infants could be exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation were Minami-Soma, Iitate and Kawamata to the northwest of the Fukushima plant as well as part of Iwaki that lies south of the plant.The 100-millisievert figure is one factor in determining if an exposed individual should take non-radioactive iodine as a precaution against thyroid gland cancer.SPEEDI makes its calculations based on the location of the nuclear power plant, the type, amount and height of the radioactive material dispersed, topographical features as well as weather data.(Copyright 2011 the Asahi Shimbun.

Here are the list of intentionally falsified news reported by CNN Turk correspondent Fulya Soybas in evening news presented by Mehmet Ali Birand- As the news was live, the local time in Tokyo at that moment was about ""2:22AM in the morning"". CNN Turk Correspondent Fulya Soybas reporting from one of the narrowest streets in Tokyo, compared that street to Istanbul's Taksim Square and described it as empty due to radiation fears. - She, CNN Turk correspondent Fulya Soybas, mentioned that she got special permission from Japanese authorities to go outside in Tokyo after 9PM as there was strict curfew in Tokyo, meanwhile there many cars, taxis and people were passing by during live broadcast from Tokyo. - She, CNN Turk correspondent Fulya Soybas, also mentioned that everybody in Tokyo were wearing Radiation Masks outside while She and Turkish Citizens she was interviewing were any mask.  - Mehmet Ali Birand named the nuclear plant name as Fujiyama although the name of the plant is Fukushima,- During live news, Kanal D TV also showed footage of the fire in Sendai Petrochemical Refinery as it was actually the fire in Fukushima Nuclear Plant.- Turkish Citizen interviewed by CNN Correspondent Fulya Soybas, said that they would like to go Turkey but they cannot find empty seats in the flights and asked Turkish Government to evacuate them from Tokyo. There were enough low cost economy seats during that time, even Turkish Airlines canceled one of flight arranged by Turkish Government due to no demand.These all fabricated/intentionally falsified news broadcasted to attract more audience were reported to Turkish Radio and Television Supreme Council with a letter below:Sayin Yetkili,Su an Japonya-Tokyo’da ikamet etmekte olan Türkiye Cumhuriyeti vatandaslari olarak, 16.03.2011 tarihi saat 19:00’da Kanal D Ana Haber’de yayimlanan yalan ve yanlis haberle ilgili olarak sikayette bulunmak istiyoruz.

Özellikle dikkatimizi çeken gerçek disi, yanlis bilgiler ve saptirmalari asagida listeliyoruz.1- Her seyden önce, ekranda görünen haber basliklari tamamen provokatif: “Radyasyondan Canli”, “Durum Çok Çok Ciddi”2- Japonya’da Fujiyama diye bir nükleer santral yok.3- Reaktörlerde herhangi bir yangin çikmadi.

Japonya’dan giden yabancilarin arttigi dogru fakat yogun bir sezon olmadigi için THY’de bile çok uygun fiyatlara bilet bulmak mümkündür. Hatta düzenlenecek TK5401 numarali ek sefer, talep olmamasi nedeniyle iptal edilmistir.6- Fukusima 1. No’lu Nükleer Santral tesisinin 30 km yariçapi haricinde, Tokyo’da ya da her hangi baska bir sehirde hiçbir zaman eve siginma gibi bir durum yasanmamis, resmi tatil olmamis, iletisim, posta ve ulastirma sektörleri basta olmak üzere, insanlar 12 Mart 2011 itibariyle normal islerine dönmüs, çalismaktadirlar.7- Haberde iddia edildigi gibi gece saat 9'dan sonra disari çikmak yasaklanmadi. Diyelim ki yasaklandi, bu bahsi geçen özel izin hangi makamdan alinmis? Hem neden aksam 9? Nükleer sizinti aksam 9'da günlük salinimina ara mi veriyor?8- Tokyo’da kimsede gaz maskesi yok ve kimse deprem çantalariyla ortalikta gezmiyorken ve dahasi kendisi maske bulundurmuyorken, bu bilgiyi hangi kaynaga dayandirarak halka sunabiliyor?9- Altyazida gecen “50 kamikaze” haberi nasil bir hayal dünyasinin ürünüdür anlamak mümkün degildir. Santral ve çevresinde çalismalarini 16 mart itibariyle sürdüren itfaiye ve teknik ekiplerde toplam 180 kisi vardir…10- Haberin sonundaki M. Ali Birand’in “Haberi maberi birak, kendini koru” demesi habercilikten tamamen uzak olan, sergilenen bu tiyatroyu çok güzel tamamlayan bir mizansenden ibarettir.Kisaca, biz Japonya’da yasayan Türkiye Cumhuriyeti vatandaslari olarak, bu türlü yanlis ve yalan haberlerden dolayi çok büyük sikinti içindeyiz.

Par ailleurs, un taux anormal de radioactivité a été décelé sur un navire marchand japonais ayant accosté lundi dans un port du sud-est de la Chine, a également annoncé l'Administration générale de la supervision de la qualité, de l'inspection et de la quarantaine (AQSIQ), sans fournir toutefois de précision sur l'importance de cette radioactivité.Les deux Japonais, qui avaient effectué un vol reliant Tokyo à Wuxi, dans la province orientale chinoise du Jiangsu, présentaient un niveau de radioactivité ""dépassant gravement les limites"" autorisées, a annoncé l'AQSIQ. Ces Japonais résidaient dans un rayon de 200 à 350 kilomètres de la centrale nucléaire de Fukushima, très endommagée par le séisme et le raz-de-marée du 11 mars dans l'est du Japon. Tokyo est à 250 kilomètres de la centrale. Les deux voyageurs ont été hospitalisés dans la ville de Suzhou (est) ""pour recevoir un traitement"", précise l'administration sur son site, et ""leurs bagages et vêtements ont été détruits"". Contacté par l'Agence France-Presse, un médecin à l'hôpital a indiqué que les Japonais avaient subi des examens, été ""décontaminés"" et avaient ensuite quitté l'hôpital.

Des particules radioactives y avaient été détectées sur 26 passagers d'avions en provenance du Japon - chaussures et vêtements essentiellement -, mais les niveaux détectés n'avaient pas été considérés comme dangereux. Par ailleurs, l'AQSIQ a également annoncé que des quantités anormales de particules radioactives avaient été décelées, lundi, sur un navire marchand japonais dans le port de Xiamen (sud-est), dans la province du Fujian, face à Taïwan. L'AQSIQ a précisé que le navire, qui avait quitté Tokyo le 17 mars, appartenait à Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, un transporteur maritime qui dessert le monde entier. Un porte-parole de l'AQSIQ a précisé à l'agence Chine nouvelle que le bateau était toujours à quai, mais on ignorait si c'est le bâtiment qui était contaminé ou la marchandise qu'il transporte.L'AQSIQ a demandé, depuis lundi, des contrôles systématiques sur la nourriture importée en Chine en provenance du Japon.
