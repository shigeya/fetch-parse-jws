Oggi è una capitale in agonia. Si presenta come prossima al collasso e prevede il peggio. In poche ore la residua fiducia ha ceduto allo sconforto. L&#39;esodo lento dei giorni scorsi ha assunto la dimensione della fuga. Oltre quattro milioni di abitanti hanno lasciato la città in treno, o ammassati in auto. Colletti bianchi, stranieri e famiglie con bambini cercano di raggiungere le località a sud del Kansai, per mettersi al riparo dal pericolo della nube atomica. Nella periferia nord di Tokyo arriva invece l&#39;onda dei disperati che scappano da Fukushima e dalle città distrutte dallo tsunami. A far precipitare la situazione, l&#39;innalzamento del livello di rischio nei reattori, nuove scosse di terremoto e la convinzione che il governo minimizzi una crisi fuori controllo. È scattato però anche il primo vero allarme-contaminazione. Il governo ha ammesso che tracce di iodio radioattivo sono state rinvenute nell&#39;acqua potabile di Tokyo e delle aree vicine. Livelli anomali, ufficialmente sotto i limiti di legge e non immediatamente pericolosi per la salute, ma l&#39;impatto pubblico della notizia è stato tremendo. Radioattivi anche il latte proveniente da Fukishima e alcune partite di spinaci prodotti nella prefettura di Ibaraki. Già in commercio, non si sa dove siano finiti. La popolazione dell&#39;area metropolitana, oltre 35 milioni di individui, prende atto che la vita di una delle capitali più importanti del mondo è già irriconoscibile. La domanda non è più quando Tokyo tornerà al business e alla quotidianità smarrita, ma se ciò risulterà possibile. Il crollo del traffico e della folla per strada è impressionante.<br/><br/>Pochi passanti, protetti da cappelli, ombrelli e mascherine, ignorano i centri commerciali del centro, in gran parte chiusi. La sindrome da alimenti contaminati lascia deserti i ristoranti e decima chi finora si era dedicato all&#39;accaparramento di viveri. A Ginza, la via dello shopping, alcuni ambulanti mettono all&#39;asta compresse di iodio sul marciapiede, a prezzi esorbitanti, come fossero spacciatori. A ruba un unico genere: i giornali che informano sugli orari dei black-out. Da tre giorni l&#39;immondizia si accumula per le strade. I camion sono privi di benzina e gli inceneritori non possono sprecare elettricità. Solo il tempio di Senso-Ji, ad Asakusa, è affollato più del solito. La gente si raduna a pregare e a bruciare incenso. I cibi confezionati, purché prodotti prima dell&#39;11 marzo, sono introvabili e il loro prezzo è salito di sette volte. Invenduti i generi freschi. Migliaia di taxi sostano in attesa di clienti già lontani, mentre le stazioni dei treni scoppiano di viaggiatori carichi di scatole e valigie. Molti distributori di carburante sono chiusi e quelli aperti non vendono più di dieci litri di benzina a testa, da portarsi via in una tanica. Il mercato immobiliare è impazzito. In una settimana il valore delle case a Tokyo è sceso del 30%, del 70% nella prefettura di Fukushima. A Osaka, Kyoto e Kobe è salito del 40%.<br/><br/>Grattacieli con migliaia di uffici si svuotano nella capitale, mentre affittare lontano può superare i listini di Hong Kong. Tra venerdì e ieri la fuga di multinazionali, ambasciate, banche e centri amministrativi delle industrie, ha seminato il panico tra chi non ha un luogo sicuro dove rifugiarsi. Nel distretto finanziario migliaia di impiegati stanno sgomberando armadi e scrivanie, restituendo un&#39;immagine da crack in Borsa. La capitale trasloca a Kyoto, come un tempo, oppure a portata dell&#39;aeroporto internazionale di Osaka. A Tokyo i grandi alberghi chiudono, a sud è impossibile trovare una camera per settimane. La rabbia contro il governo è sempre meno trattenuta. &quot;Devono dire in anticipo cosa può succedere - dice Reiko Fukushima, direttore di un&#39;importante catena di negozi - non confessare quanto è già avvenuto. Se la nube atomica investe Tokyo non possono pretendere che smettiamo di respirare&quot;. Il premier Naoto Kan ha invitato invano l&#39;opposizione di centrodestra a formare un direttorio di unità nazionale, per affrontare uniti l&#39;emergenza più grave dalla fine della seconda guerra mondiale. All&#39;agonia di Tokyo e allo spettro di un&#39;esplosione nucleare, si somma l&#39;ecatombe nelle prefetture sommerse dallo tsunami. La capitale è presa d&#39;assalto da migliaia di eco-evacuati e da decine di migliaia di senza tetto fuggiti da gelo, fame e terrore. <br/><br/>Volontari distribuiscono pasti, acqua e coperte. La folla dei disperati ha però bisogno di medicine, toilette, letti, di lavarsi e cambiare vestiti fradici. L&#39;intero villaggio di Futunaba, vicino a Fukushima, ieri è stato trasferito a Saitanama, poco a nord di Tokyo, causando la sollevazione dei residenti. Secondo i medici l&#39;emergenza igienico-sanitaria, con 800 mila persone costrette per ragioni diverse ad abbandonare case e ospedali, è prossima ad esplodere non solo nelle zone disastrate. Tragico il problema dello smaltimento delle vittime dello tsunami, fra 25 e 40 mila. I forni crematori non hanno energia e le bare finiscono in fosse comuni. In Giappone l&#39;inumazione è una traumatica novità: l&#39;ultima violenza di un incubo che sembra lontano dalla fine.<br/><td  class='s3'>9<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2011/03/20/news/tokyo_capitale_in_agonia-13852633/">http://www.repubblica.it/esteri/2011/03/20/news/tokyo_capitale_in_agonia-13852633/</a><td  class='s2'>Pure journalistic terrorism.... terrorismo giornalistico puro.<br/>Untrue and false</tr><tr><td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td><td  class='s1'>3/20/2011 22:12:35<td  class='s2'>no name<td  class='s2'>16-3-2011<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.corriere.it/cronache/11_marzo_16/celentano_trappola_radiattiva_e30fc2d6-4fb0-11e0-acff-d18cea4068c4.shtml">http://www.corriere.it/cronache/11_marzo_16/celentano_trappola_radiattiva_e30fc2d6-4fb0-11e0-acff-d18cea4068c4.shtml</a><td  class='s2'>This is one of the national papers in Italy.

While it does go on to say that the levels are under legal limits and harmless, it qualifies this statement with the word &quot;officially&quot; (&quot;ufficialmente&quot;). Throughout the article, the author appears to make skillful use of loaded words so as to imply more than it actually says. Details such as the fact that people wear masks (as they always do in Japan because of colds or pollen allergies) are used to suggest that people are scared of radiation. It says  that restaurants are empty because of the fear of &quot;contaminated foods&quot; (&quot;alimenti contaminati&quot;). Packed foods produced before 11 March are supposed to be sold at seven times the original price, the value of real estate in Tokyo is said to have fallen by 30%.  &quot;Anger against the goverment&quot; (&quot;rabbia contro il governo&quot;) is said to be rising.

Instead he used the &quot;thousand fold&quot; statement to imply an attempted coverup when in fact the Japanese government was, even if translated correctly,<br/>grossly exaggerating, not covering up.    </tr></table><tr><td><table border=0 cellpadding=0 cellspacing=0 class='tblGenFixed' id='tblMain_6'><tr class='rShim'><td class='rShim' style='width:0;'><td class='rShim' style='width:2px;'><td class='rShim' style='width:74px;'><td class='rShim' style='width:56px;'><td class='rShim' style='width:108px;'><td class='rShim' style='width:317px;'><td class='rShim' style='width:61px;'><td class='rShim' style='width:184px;'><td class='rShim' style='width:253px;'><tr><td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td><td  class='s1'>3/22/2011 16:07:49<td  class='s2'>Robert Hetkämpfer <td  class='s2'>21-03-2011<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.welt.de">www.welt.de</a><td  class='s2'>Headline &quot;Is Tepco sending homeless people into the Nuclear Power Plant?&quot;<br/><br/>He claims that Tepco is sending homeless and minor into the NPP.<br/><br/>GERMAN NEWS REPORTER IS FROM ARD Erstes Deutsches Fernsehen<td  class='s3'>10<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/weltgeschehen/article12901818/Schickt-Tepco-Obdachlose-ins-AKW.html">http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/weltgeschehen/article12901818/Schickt-Tepco-Obdachlose-ins-AKW.html</a><td  class='s4'></tr><tr><td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td><td  class='s1'>3/22/2011 16:22:13<td  class='s2'>Hurriyet Web Site <td  class='s2'>23-02-2011<td  class='s2'>Turkish Hurriyet Website<td  class='s2'>Reporting wrong information released by WHO by saying there is serious a short-term heath risk from contaminated food chain although WHO reported as &quot;No short-term risk from contaminated food&quot;. <br/><br/><br/>In Turkish it was reported as below<br/><br/>&quot;Besin zincirinde tehlike büyük<br/><br/>Dünya Sağlık Örgütü WHO, Japonya’da süt ve ıspanakta bulunan radyasyon ile başlayan, gıda zincirindeki kirlenmenin tahminlerden çok büyük olduğu uyarısında bulundu.<br/><br/>Örgütün sözcüsü Peter Cordingley, Filipinler’in başkenti Manila’da yaptığı açıklamada, “Japonların söylediğinden çok daha büyük bir tehlike söz konusu.

Radiations exists in nature and can be absorbed when you are on a long haul flight.

It really was that much of a sensationalist, speculative mess that the SPIEGEL ONLINE made the SUN-like tabloid online format of BILD.DE look like the Time Magazine. In these days, the online formats of the German newspapers showed their biggest weakness: lack of quality control and wild speculation. In fact, the news that SPIEGEL ONLINE and BILD.DE produced had little difference in terms of the content and information value. Only BILD had a more sensationalist design, which makes it at least straightforward in its trashy makeup. The SPIEGEL, however, tries to give an impression of sincere Journalism, which in this case failed spectacularly. 10 out of 10 points on the shame scale, because trying to look like a honest news magazine whilst making up wild stories is cheap sensationalism. <td  class='s3'>10<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.spiegel.de">www.spiegel.de</a><td  class='s2'>after many complaints, they seem to try to limit the fantasy and fiction elements in their reports, however, they often fail</tr><tr><td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td><td  class='s1'>3/23/2011 7:32:16<td  class='s2'>Nancy Grace<td  class='s2'>21-3-2011<td  class='s2'>CNN<td  class='s2'>After depicting an apocalyptic scenario of the situation in Japan, Miss Grace did not even let a weatherman talk about the dynamics of radiations, suggesting dramatic effects on American soil, claiming unverified facts with obvious fear in her voice tone.<br/><br/>This was simply fear-mongering of the worst category : refusing to listen to the specialist.

Why interview anyone and waste their time if you are just going to confirm what you already &quot;knew&quot; about the other - that you are &quot;stoic.&quot;<td  class='s3'>3<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12798799">http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-pacific-12798799</a><td  class='s4'></tr><tr><td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td><td  class='s1'>3/24/2011 19:57:32<td  class='s2'>AJW by the Asahi Shimbun<td  class='s2'>24-03-2011<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=162706927116284&amp;set=a.157475197639457.39036.157466287640348&amp;theater">http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=162706927116284&amp;set=a.157475197639457.39036.157466287640348&amp;theater</a><td  class='s2'>Fear mongering, again. AJW (Asahi Japan Watch) by the Asahi Shimbun published the following on their facebook page, which shows a calculation based on *extreme* conditions and not based on fact.<br/><br/>NSC releases predicted radiation exposure using extreme conditions<br/><br/>After coming under fire, the Nuclear Safety Commission of Japan for the first time on Wednesday released predicted ranges of radiation exposure and radioactive materials from the Fukushima No. 1 nuclear power plant.<br/>The calculations were made using the System for Prediction of Environmental Emergency Dose Information (SPEEDI).<br/>Emphasizing that its predictions were based on extreme conditions, the commission said the thyroid glands of 1-year-old infants could be exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation over a 12-day period--even outside a 30-kilometer radius from the plant--if iodine is dispersed in a northwesterly and southerly directions.<br/>The government had recommended that residents living within a 20-km radius evacuate and that those living between a 20- to 30-km radius remain indoors as much as possible.<br/>&quot;We made the calculations using very extreme conditions. There will be no need to implement measures immediately,&quot; NSC Chairman Haruki Madarame said.<br/>The calculations were based on the scenario of infants being outdoors for the entire 12-day period between 6 a.m. March 12 and midnight Wednesday, after the Great East Japan Earthquake struck on March 11 and damaged the nuclear plant.<br/>The calculations found that if the infant remained indoors exposure to iodine would decrease to one-quarter to one-tenth of the most extreme calculation.<br/>The levels of radioactive iodine dispersed were calculated based on radiation monitoring data recorded at various locations, and the exposure calculation was made for a 1-year child whose thyroid gland would be most affected by iodine.<br/>The NSC had previously not released such predictions, saying the data were only rough figures that could be inaccurate. Critics said the commission should release as much information as possible about the nuclear crisis.<br/>According to Wednesday&#39;s calculations, the municipalities where infants could be exposed to more than 100 millisieverts of radiation were Minami-Soma, Iitate and Kawamata to the northwest of the Fukushima plant as well as part of Iwaki that lies south of the plant.<br/>The 100-millisievert figure is one factor in determining if an exposed individual should take non-radioactive iodine as a precaution against thyroid gland cancer.<br/>SPEEDI makes its calculations based on the location of the nuclear power plant, the type, amount and height of the radioactive material dispersed, topographical features as well as weather data.<br/><br/>(Copyright 2011 the Asahi Shimbun.

Bu insanlarin Japonya disindaki akraba ve yakinlarini da düsündügünüzde, bir yalan haber yüzünden on binlerce kisinin ciddi sekilde etkilendigini öngörebilirsiniz.<br/> <br/>Yayimlanmis haberde ne yazik ki, dogru tek bir bilgi yok. Özellikle dikkatimizi çeken gerçek disi, yanlis bilgiler ve saptirmalari asagida listeliyoruz.<br/> <br/>1- Her seyden önce, ekranda görünen haber basliklari tamamen provokatif: “Radyasyondan Canli”, “Durum Çok Çok Ciddi”<br/> <br/>2- Japonya’da Fujiyama diye bir nükleer santral yok.<br/> <br/>3- Reaktörlerde herhangi bir yangin çikmadi. Verilen yangin görüntüleri bir petrokimya rafinerisinde çikan yanginlardan alinmadir ve ilgisi yoktur.<br/> <br/>4- Muhabirin “Burasi Taksim gibi islek bir cadde” dedigi sokak görüntülerden de anlasilacagi gibi taksinin bile zor sigdigi arka sokaklardan birisi”. Dahasiö haberin yayinlandigi saat itibariyle Japonya’da saat geceyarisi 02:00 sularidir. Bu saatte o sokakta o kadar taksinin geçmesi bile büyük kalabalik sayilabilecekken, bu sekilde bir yaniltma art niyetten ve sansasyon yaratmaktan öte bir sey degildir.<br/> <br/>5- Haber sirasinda yorumlari alinan vatandaslarimizdan alinan bilgilere dayanilarak, uçaklarda yer yok deniyor. Japonya’dan giden yabancilarin arttigi dogru fakat yogun bir sezon olmadigi için THY’de bile çok uygun fiyatlara bilet bulmak mümkündür. Hatta düzenlenecek TK5401 numarali ek sefer, talep olmamasi nedeniyle iptal edilmistir.<br/> <br/>6- Fukusima 1. No’lu Nükleer Santral tesisinin 30 km yariçapi haricinde, Tokyo’da ya da her hangi baska bir sehirde hiçbir zaman eve siginma gibi bir durum yasanmamis, resmi tatil olmamis, iletisim, posta ve ulastirma sektörleri basta olmak üzere, insanlar 12 Mart 2011 itibariyle normal islerine dönmüs, çalismaktadirlar.<br/> <br/>7- Haberde iddia edildigi gibi gece saat 9&#39;dan sonra disari çikmak yasaklanmadi. Diyelim ki yasaklandi, bu bahsi geçen özel izin hangi makamdan alinmis? Hem neden aksam 9? Nükleer sizinti aksam 9&#39;da günlük salinimina ara mi veriyor?<br/> <br/>8- Tokyo’da kimsede gaz maskesi yok ve kimse deprem çantalariyla ortalikta gezmiyorken ve dahasi kendisi maske bulundurmuyorken, bu bilgiyi hangi kaynaga dayandirarak halka sunabiliyor?<br/> <br/>9- Altyazida gecen “50 kamikaze” haberi nasil bir hayal dünyasinin ürünüdür anlamak mümkün degildir. Santral ve çevresinde çalismalarini 16 mart itibariyle sürdüren itfaiye ve teknik ekiplerde toplam 180 kisi vardir…<br/> <br/>10- Haberin sonundaki M. Ali Birand’in “Haberi maberi birak, kendini koru” demesi habercilikten tamamen uzak olan, sergilenen bu tiyatroyu çok güzel tamamlayan bir mizansenden ibarettir.<br/> <br/>Kisaca, biz Japonya’da yasayan Türkiye Cumhuriyeti vatandaslari olarak, bu türlü yanlis ve yalan haberlerden dolayi çok büyük sikinti içindeyiz.

The idea of using absorbent polymer, late in the game, to staunch a really large and ongoing leak of radioactive water? It&#39;s an interesting idea.

This was this week and they both live in France.</tr><tr><td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td><td  class='s1'>4/14/2011 19:27:45<td  class='s2'>William Broad, Hiroko Tabuchi<td  class='s2'>14-03-2011<td  class='s2'>New York Times<td  class='s2'>just plain scary, and in hindsight probably injustified<td  class='s3'>4<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/asia/15fuel.html">http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/15/world/asia/15fuel.html</a><td  class='s4'></tr><tr><td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td><td  class='s1'>4/14/2011 20:54:45<td  class='s2'>Michio Kaku<td  class='s2'>13-04-2011<td  class='s2'>Democracy Now<td  class='s2'>There&#39;s nothing, nothing that comes out of Michio Kaku&#39;s mouth that is even close to the fact.<br/>Severity of Offense 12 (his brain is experiencing a meltdown)<td  class='s3'>10<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://www.democracynow.org/2011/4/13/expert_despite_japanese_govt_claims_of">http://www.democracynow.org/2011/4/13/expert_despite_japanese_govt_claims_of</a><td  class='s4'></tr><tr><td class=hd><p style='height:16px;'>.</td><td  class='s1'>4/14/2011 21:12:40<td  class='s2'>AFP cited as source<td  class='s2'>25-03-2011<td  class='s2'><a target="_blank" href="http://lepoint.fr">lepoint.fr</a><td  class='s2'>Deux Japonais hospitalisés à leur arrivée en Chine pour cause d&#39;irradiation<br/><br/>Le Point.fr - Publié le 25/03/2011 à 07:24 - Modifié le 25/03/2011 à 08:58<br/>Ces deux personnes résidaient dans un rayon de 200 à 350 kilomètres de la centrale nucléaire de Fukushima.<br/><br/><br/>Source AFP<br/><br/>Deux Japonais ont été brièvement hospitalisés après leur arrivée mercredi en Chine par un vol commercial en provenance de Tokyo, parce qu&#39;ils présentaient des taux élevés de radioactivité, a annoncé, vendredi, l&#39;administration chinoise chargée de la quarantaine. Par ailleurs, un taux anormal de radioactivité a été décelé sur un navire marchand japonais ayant accosté lundi dans un port du sud-est de la Chine, a également annoncé l&#39;Administration générale de la supervision de la qualité, de l&#39;inspection et de la quarantaine (AQSIQ), sans fournir toutefois de précision sur l&#39;importance de cette radioactivité.<br/><br/>Les deux Japonais, qui avaient effectué un vol reliant Tokyo à Wuxi, dans la province orientale chinoise du Jiangsu, présentaient un niveau de radioactivité &quot;dépassant gravement les limites&quot; autorisées, a annoncé l&#39;AQSIQ. Ces Japonais résidaient dans un rayon de 200 à 350 kilomètres de la centrale nucléaire de Fukushima, très endommagée par le séisme et le raz-de-marée du 11 mars dans l&#39;est du Japon. Tokyo est à 250 kilomètres de la centrale. Les deux voyageurs ont été hospitalisés dans la ville de Suzhou (est) &quot;pour recevoir un traitement&quot;, précise l&#39;administration sur son site, et &quot;leurs bagages et vêtements ont été détruits&quot;. Contacté par l&#39;Agence France-Presse, un médecin à l&#39;hôpital a indiqué que les Japonais avaient subi des examens, été &quot;décontaminés&quot; et avaient ensuite quitté l&#39;hôpital. &quot;Ils ne devraient pas avoir constitué un danger pour les autres voyageurs&quot;, a estimé l&#39;AQSIQ.<br/><br/>Risque de psychose<br/><br/>Depuis les accidents en chaîne à la centrale nucléaire japonaise de Fukushima, hormis la Chine, les seuls cas de voyageurs japonais à l&#39;étranger présentant des taux anormaux de radioactivité ont été annoncés à Taiwan, le 17 mars. Des particules radioactives y avaient été détectées sur 26 passagers d&#39;avions en provenance du Japon - chaussures et vêtements essentiellement -, mais les niveaux détectés n&#39;avaient pas été considérés comme dangereux. Par ailleurs, l&#39;AQSIQ a également annoncé que des quantités anormales de particules radioactives avaient été décelées, lundi, sur un navire marchand japonais dans le port de Xiamen (sud-est), dans la province du Fujian, face à Taïwan. L&#39;AQSIQ a précisé que le navire, qui avait quitté Tokyo le 17 mars, appartenait à Mitsui O.S.K. Lines, un transporteur maritime qui dessert le monde entier. Un porte-parole de l&#39;AQSIQ a précisé à l&#39;agence Chine nouvelle que le bateau était toujours à quai, mais on ignorait si c&#39;est le bâtiment qui était contaminé ou la marchandise qu&#39;il transporte.<br/><br/>L&#39;AQSIQ a demandé, depuis lundi, des contrôles systématiques sur la nourriture importée en Chine en provenance du Japon. Ces nouvelles sont susceptibles de relancer la psychose d&#39;une contamination qui s&#39;était emparée des Chinois après les accidents à la centrale de Fukushima. De nombreuses personnes avaient dévalisé les rayons de sel iodé dans les magasins, croyant se prémunir contre des risques de contamination radioactive, en dépit des mises au point répétées du gouvernement.<br/><br/>Sensational headline: Two Japanese nationals hospitalized on reaching China because of irradiation<br/><br/>Then: These two people lived in a 250 to 300 km radius from the Fukushima nuclear plant<br/> <br/>The article then says Tokyo is 250 km from Fukushima, implying that there are radiations there. <br/>It then quotes the Chinese hospital (no hospital name, only the city&#39;s) as saying that the Japanese nationals had been hospitalized for treatment, and their clothes and luggage destroyed.<br/>It further quotes a doctor at the hospital (unnamed) as saying the Japanese nationals had undergone tests, had been decontaminated and released, and that they should not have presented a danger  to the other travellers.<br/><br/>SO WHY THE HEADLINE?<br/><td  class='s3'>4<td  class='s4'><td  class='s2'>at least one other French regional newspaper (Ouest-France) has reported the same incident on its website without reporting the sequel, i-e, the Japanese nationals eventually released.<br/><br/>Radioactivité: deux Japonais hospitalisés à leur arrivée en Chine<br/>Santé vendredi 25 mars 2011<br/><br/>Deux Japonais ont été hospitalisés après leur arrivée mercredi en Chine en provenance de Tokyo sur un vol commercial parce qu&#39;ils présentaient de «graves» taux de radioactivité, a annoncé vendredi l&#39;Administration chinoise chargée de la sécurité et de la quarantaine.<br/><br/>Les deux Japonais, qui avaient effectué un vol Tokyo-Wuxi, dans la province orientale chinoise du Jiangsu, présentaient un niveau de radioactivité «dépassant gravement les limites» autorisées, a annoncé l&#39;Administration générale de la supervision de la qualité, de l&#39;inspection et de la quarantaine.<br/><br/>Auparavant, seul des cas de Japonais présentant des taux anormaux de radioactivité ont été annoncés à Taïwan, le 17 mars, après les accidents en chaîne à la centrale nucléaire japonaise de Fukushima.<br/><br/>Ces deux Japonais résidaient dans un rayon de 200 à 350 km de la centrale nucléaire de Fukushima.

This, however, is standard practice in many countries, e.g. Switzerland. But according to this article, this would not have been the case in Fukushima, if not for corruption. Because of this there is now Plutonium leaking.
